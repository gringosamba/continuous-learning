# continuous-learning
This repository contains projects I have completed as part of my continuous learning journey.

Sometimes there is a bug in github when trying to open a jupyter notebook file. If it doesn't open, please just click to reload and try again. Eventually, it opens. Otherwise, another simple option is to click the three dots in the upper right hand corner of the screen (next to "Go to File" button) and copy the permalink for the file you wish to view in my repository and paste the URL in the Jupyter Notebook Viewer website https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ for an easy rendering of the notebook.
